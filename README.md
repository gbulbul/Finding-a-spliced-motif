Before starting, let me confess something: this task was challenging!

The task can be explained as when two DNA strings (s and t) are given, the smaller DNA string (s) can occur in the longer DNA string (t) in multiple places. The aim was to find out the positions/places where these motifs occur over the longer DNA string. The tricky part is that the motifs sometimes can be hidden in a way that the motif elements can be dispersed rather than following a subsequent order.
